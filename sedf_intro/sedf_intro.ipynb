    "This notebook will introduce Esri's Spatially Enabled DataFrame structure, which is part of the ArcGIS API for Python. It's an extremely handy tool in certain situations, as it extends the Pandas DataFrame structure to add spatial capabilities. The GeoPandas package provides similar functionality, but it introduces varying levels of frustration depending on the environment you're trying to use it in. The ArcGIS API for Python (along with Pandas and ArcPy) is already conveniently installed in the default ArcGIS Pro Python environment. The Spatially Enabled DataFrame gives us access to some powerful data cleaning and analysis tools. Further, it integrates well with Jupyter Notebooks and gives us some decent visualization options completely outside the confines of ArcGIS Pro.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: For simplicity, this tutorial assumes you have access to the default ArcGIS Pro Python environment. This environment includes the ArcGIS API for Python, ArcPy, and Pandas, all of which we'll make use of. You can, however, use the Spatially Enabled DataFrame with a standard Python installation.  Installation instructions are at: https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/. You'll also need to install Pandas. Unlike most Esri products, the API for Python is freely available and doesn't require any sort of license. They assume you'll be using this with an ArcGIS Enterprise setup or ArcGIS Online, and they enforce this by requiring either access to ArcPy or authentication to ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise. Read/write from/to feature classes is usually done with ArcPy, but it can be done with the pyshp package (shapely and fiona are also required) as long as you are able to authenticate somehow. This makes it possible to run in an environment without access to the typical ArcGIS Python installation.*"
